            <h2>Project 1: <a href="https://github.com/lpjones/Object-Detection-and-Tracking">Object Detection and Tracking</a></h2>
            <p>The assignment asked us, one other group member and I, to 
                take in a video and count the number of people that enter 
                the camera frame. We were given a file that registered and 
                updated the different IDs for each person. Using that file 
                we passed each frame of the video sequentially through the 
                yolo model to identify people before updating the IDs using 
                the given sort.py file. We then used the added a display on 
                the output video to show how many people had been in frame.

            <p>We also created an image detector that takes an image and draws 
                bounding boxes labeling each class found in the image along with 
                its confidence score
            </p>

            <h2>Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/lpjones/Path-Finding">Path Finding</a></h2>
            <p>We created a maze solver that takes in a maze file and finds the shortest 
                path from the start to end points using either dijkstra's or the A-star 
                algorithms. We also created a display to show how the maze is solved using
                the specified algorithm. The below video shows the program solving a maze
                using the A-star algorithm.

            <h2>Project 3: <a href="https://github.com/lpjones/Path-Tracking-and-Object-Removal">Path Tracking and Object Removal</a></h2>
            <p>We created our own tracking method based on the centroid of the bounding 
                boxes in each frame and used it to keep track of people within the video 
                and trace the path they have traveled.

            <p>We also created an object removal program that finds and removes a 
                specified class for an image and replaces it with a specified chunk 
                to the right of the object. Below shows the removal of people from a
                picture of a beach.
